# 👋 Hi there, I'm Zdenko (aka MrGegaz)

🎓 I'm a computer science student who’s still exploring which path to follow in tech — because too many things seem interesting until I try them out!\
🎮 In my free time, I enjoy airsoft, gaming, hiking, tinkering with DIY projects, and hanging out with my wife and dog 🐶.

## 💡 About Me
- 🔭 Currently learning C# and experimenting with AvaloniaUI (on Linux, not Windows 😄)
- 🧠 Interested in IoT, app development, 3D printing, and game dev (I'd love to make an indie game one day!)
- ✍️ I also do some 3D modeling for my own printing needs.
